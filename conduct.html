      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

      <p>We’re a small group that is growing and becoming a larger group. We don’t expect that to lead to bad behavior, but we’d like to be proactive and make sure everyone treats each other fairly and consistently. The goal of this Code of Conduct is to allow people the opportunity to speak out if they feel uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>tl;dr: Be Excellent to Each Other</p>

      <p>Here are the rules for the meetup:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We’re a group of professionals, hobbyists and students, and we would like everyone to continue treating each other with the same respect they show to coworkers, friends, classmates and family. We’d like members to continue speaking well of each other and address any interpersonal problems instead of letting them continue.</li>
        <li>If someone is being rude or unkind, please don’t participate! Stick up for each other.</li>
        <li>If someone is harassing* another member, please tell them to stop and let an organizer/host (currently Michael, Jacob and Daniel) know about it. If Michael, Jacob or Daniel are causing the problem, talk to the other organizers/hosts.</li>
        <li>If someone is harassing you, the organizers and/or other members will address it if they know about it, so please make them aware.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here are some clarifications:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>By ‘addressing,’ we mean anything from a quiet word in private (preferred) to asking the person not to attend future events (last resort).</li>
        <li>Obviously, we will call the police if a crime is committed.</li>
        <li>We use a “battle-tested,” boilerplate definition of harassment, which is: <em>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</em></li>
      </ul>
